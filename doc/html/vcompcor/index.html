<div class="subtitle"><b>Background</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program 'vcompcor' tries to remove physiological noise from fMRI data.
The algorithm assumes that high temporal variance is indicative of physiological noise.
The first step is to identify regions of high temporal variance. The second step 
is to obtain the first few principal components of these regions amd finally these components
are factored out via linear regression.

<div class="subtitle"><b>Usage</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program expects fMRI time series data as input. The algorithm expects the data
to be baseline corrected. If they are not already baseline corrected by some previous processing step,
they should be corrected within 'vcompcor' using frequency cutoffs similar to the
program 'vpreprocess'. 
In order to identify regions dominated by physiological noise, 'vcompcor' computes the temporal
variance in each voxel and creates a ranking so that high variance voxels receive high ranks.
A variance threshold '-fraction' must be specified. 
It defines the fraction of voxels that are included into the region of interest.
For example, if 'fraction' is set to 0.02, then the top 2 percent high variance voxels are
included into the ROI. <br>
It may often be helpful to check temporal variance as it is the criterium by which voxels are included
into the ROI. Therefore, an additional image is created which provides a variance map (not thresholded).
Its name can be specified by the parameter '-r2'.<br>
Below is an example.</p>
